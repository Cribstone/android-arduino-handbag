TinyAccessory -- simplified example for Android Arduino Uno accessory
=====================================================================

TinyAccessory is stripped down and lightly modified from the original
'demokit'/'DemoKit' example available from Google.

The Android application and Arduino Uno (or similar) sketch work
together to provide a single instance of various types of inputs &
outputs.

They are:

  * Analog input
  * Digital input
  * PWM ("analog") output
  * Digital output

The purpose of this is to make it easier to follow how things fit
together and provide an out-of-the-box working example for the Uno.
